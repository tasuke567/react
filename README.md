#react
React is a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces. React works on the principle of components, which allows you to create complex UIs from simple components. React is also known for its performance and scalability.

## Features
Components: React uses components to create UIs. Components are small pieces of UI that can be combined to create complex UIs.
Performance: React is highly performant and can handle complex UIs.
Scalability: React is highly scalable and can be used to create large UIs.
Getting Started
To get started with React, you will need to install React on your machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

npm install react

Once you have installed React, you can create your first React app. You can do this using the following code:

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
render() {
return (
<div>
Hello, world!
</div>
);
}
}

export default App;


To run your React app, you can use the following command in your terminal:

Your React app will open at http://localhost:3000
